This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

On the Book a table page, where you select the date & time, the choices could be more specific. Instead of being able to reserve a table down to the minute, the user should only be able to book in 30 min increments.
